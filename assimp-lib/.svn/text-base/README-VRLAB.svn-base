=== HOW DO I COMPILE THIS? ===

Assimp requires:
 * The Boost library (and development headers)
 * Cmake compilation ssytem.
On Ubuntu, you can install these packages with:
  sudo apt-get install libboost-dev cmake cmake-curses-gui

To compile Assimp on your Linux machine, use the following commands:
 1) rm -f CMakeCache.txt

 2) cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_SAMPLES=ON -DASSIMP_BUILD_STATIC_LIB=ON .
    or on IVS (which has a Boost installation that is difficult to work with):
    /export/apps/src/cmake/2.8.9/cmake-2.8.9/bin/cmake -DASSIMP_BUILD_SAMPLES=ON -DASSIMP_BUILD_STATIC_LIB=ON -DASSIMP_ENABLE_BOOST_WORKAROUND=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ .


 3) make
     (When you compile on IVS, you will see lots of warnings!)

=== HOW DO I KNOW COMPILATION WORKED? ===

The assimp library comes with a simple OpenGL program that loads model files (without loading textures!) that you can test with. After you have compiled assimp, try running:

bin/assimp_simpleogl test/models/Collada/duck.dae


=== WHAT VERSION OF ASSIMP IS THIS? ===

This version of assimp is from git on Aug 1 2013 (last commit e06cdaac46):
https://github.com/assimp/assimp

Do not update this library to a newer version unless you have a good reason to. Assimp 3.0 does not compile on IVS, this newer version from git does.
