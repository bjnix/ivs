Usage: ./chromium ./slideshow image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg

You can try to access /research/kuhl/vrlab/ivs/slideshow/ to copy some of the image files from Scott. These files are large and are not checked into the SVN repository. Alternatively, you can try running the "run-slideshow.sh" script directly in that directory to run Scott's copy of the code.

Press 's' to make it automatically advance through the different images in the slideshow. Spacebar goes to the next image, 'b' goes back.

This program requires support for textures up to 4096 pixels in size. It works when run under chromium in the IVS lab.
