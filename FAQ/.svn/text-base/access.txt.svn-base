### I need card-swipe access or ivs.research.mtu.edu access.

Contact the faculty member that you are working with. They will be able to request IT to create an account for you.


### I need access to ccsr.ee.mtu.edu (the Linux machine in the IVS lab).

Contact your faculty advisor. They can request that IT can create an account for you on the machine. Or, Scott Kuhl also has access to create accounts.
